# Welcome to Cogilabs
Welcome to Cogilabs, the home of my personal projects and creations. My name is David Girou and I will really soon be an Engineer. I have always been passionate about technology and the endless possibilities it offers.

The purpose of Cogilabs is to serve as a personal brand name for my various projects and creations. From web development to IoT applications and electronic devices, I use this domain to put a name on my projects and make them more identifiable, as well as hosting those which are web-based.
Here and on my website [Cogilabs.eu](https://cogilabs.eu/), you will find some my personal projects and creations, all of which are the result of my passion for technology and problem-solving.

I hope you will enjoy your visit here, and maybe find some of my projects interesting and informative. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact me [here](https://cogilabs.eu/contact.html).

Thank you for visiting Cogilabs!
